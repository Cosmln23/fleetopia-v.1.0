  notes: "Derived from apps/backend/prisma/schema.prisma. Unique constraints include: Deal.cargoId unique, Deal.quoteId unique, Vehicle @@unique(ownerId, licensePlate). Enums present for cargo/deal/message/vehicle statuses. No RLS/role policies defined in code; refine with prisma db pull when connected to DB."
